This is my personal website with contact information and frequently asked questions. The site is currently in progress and what's visible at the moment will change drastically once I have the time to revamp the site. For now this is a start and allows me to practice and improve my html and css knowledge.

You can also visit the [live version](https://thatsfinn.com) of the site that is hosted via github pages.
